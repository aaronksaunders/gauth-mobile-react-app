# gauth-mobile-react-app

A sample app showing how to integrate the [ Capacitor Firebase Authentication Plugin from CapAwesome Team](https://github.com/capawesome-team/capacitor-firebase) in an Ionic React Application

I wrote this sample as a follow-up to the [VueJS Sample](https://github.com/aaronksaunders/mobile-gauth), and [video](https://youtu.be/64N1dIjljZo) because often I hear that there is not enough React and Vue content out there in comparison to the Angular content that exists for Ionic.


## Important
- Please make sure to follow the [installation and configuration directions](https://github.com/capawesome-team/capacitor-firebase/tree/main/packages/authentication) provided by the plugin

## Working With The Database
- - this plugin does not authenticate you with the javascript api, you will need todo that yourself in order to access the database in you mobile application
- REMEMEMER to log out of both the Plugin and the JS SDK in your application or things will get crazy
